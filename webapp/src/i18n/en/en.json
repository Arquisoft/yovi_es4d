    "description2": "The objective of the game is to connect the three sides of the board with a continuous chain of pieces, and the first player to achieve this wins the game.",
    "description3": "The basic rules are very simple: each player places a piece of their color on an empty space during their turn, without moving or removing already placed pieces.",
    "description4": "The corners of the board count as belonging to the two adjacent sides, for example, a piece at the tip of the triangle belongs to both its left and right sides.",
